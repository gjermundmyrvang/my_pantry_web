# Privacy Policy for Private Pantry App
Private Pantry stores certain user data to support its functionality. Specifically, your recipes and related content (such as titles, descriptions, ingredients, steps, and images) are securely stored using `Supabase`, a privacy-conscious backend service.

We do not collect or share any personally identifiable information beyond what's necessary for app functionality. No analytics, tracking tools, or third-party marketing services are used.

Access to your data is restricted to your authenticated account and is not visible to other users.

#### Account Deletion:
If you choose to delete your account, all data associated with your account — including your recipes, images, and any other related content — will be permanently removed from our systems.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at gjermundmyrvang@gmail.com.
